Wireless Notice Board
This code can be used for interfacing GSM Module with Arduino and displaying the data on a 32 X 8 led dot matrix

Components required:
1. Arduino UNO
2. SIM 900A GSM Module
3. 32X8 LED Dot Matrix
4. 12v Wall Adapter
5. Working SIM
6. Jumper Wires

What code is does, it waits for any message to recieve from the sender and then it takes that message which contains some redundant part 
that we remove using simple string handling and then push it to the led matrix
